This Python code implements the Caesar Cipher, a basic encryption technique where each letter in a message is shifted by a user-defined number of positions in the alphabet. The program allows users to either encrypt or decrypt a message by inputting the text and shift value. It handles both uppercase and lowercase letters while leaving non-alphabetic characters unchanged, ensuring flexibility in encryption and decryption.
